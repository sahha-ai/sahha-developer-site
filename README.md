# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Changes

If you want to make changes but not deploy to the live website, save them on a custom branch, i.e. `my-branch`.

### Deployment

Push any changes you'd like to publish to the `master` branch. GitHub Actions will build, test, and deploy the changes to the live website automatically.
