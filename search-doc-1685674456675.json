This not only impacts the data quality and data quantity for a given user, but can also lead to lower product engagement overall (when not dealing with surveys) and missed opportunities to provide the user with genuine, actionable assistance they need. Because of survey fatigue, many digital health apps do not have adequate data to identify user needs. This means they are limited in the interventions they can deliver as well as the products they need to build to serve their user communities. The result of this limitation often leads to user churn, poor adoption or retention, lower revenue, and lower positive impact. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) can be expensive to find, communicate with, and attract new users, so retention is paramount. If we need to keep users for the sake of our businesses and for the sake of their wellness, why would we leave something so mutually important to a series of tools that are intrusive, subjective, biased, and result in all parties losing out? Digital health companies need to be aware of the perceived value equation that users have with regards to their products. Requiring the user to do too much work (in this case, surveys) before they receive equivalent or more value from the product is a recipe for disaster for the company, the user, and the stakeholders on both sides. "},{"title":"Are surveys bad?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ask users to do less - reduce their survey fatigue","url":"/blog/ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their#are-surveys-bad","content":"Not at all. When used wisely, sparingly, and on a case-by-case basis, surveys offer a way to capture valuable types of data that can be difficult to come by through other means. They are powerful tools that can build trust, foster a safe environment, and invite deeper conversation. There are many surveys in use today that should continue to be used. One of our roles as innovators will be thinking of new ways to deliver these surveys as well as come up with new ones. Similarly, we have a responsibility to create new ways to combine them with other types of subjective and objective data, all for the betterment of the people we serve - our users. "},{"title":"Moving forward​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ask users to do less - reduce their survey fatigue","url":"/blog/ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their#moving-forward","content":"Capturing health data via mobile applications is much more accessible today than it was just a decade ago. Both Android and iOS provide APIs that can deliver many different types of health data to a wide variety of software applications. At Sahha, we use some of this data in our machine learning models to infer predictions of psychometric surveys for different mental health conditions, such as risk of depressive episode, allowing product creators, business executives, and other digital health leaders to decide when and where to use surveys, if at all. "},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ask users to do less - reduce their survey fatigue","url":"/blog/ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their#conclusion","content":"More and more people regularly use mobile apps that know us as individuals and, hence, provide great user experiences. We believe this puts the onus on digital health app creators to ensure the products being built match user expectations for value while retrieving the data essential for continual value delivery. By reducing survey fatigue and harnessing predictive technology, new products have a better chance of attracting and keeping users, and, above all else, earning the right to deliver them immense value for a long time.

Consumer acceptance of digital health services is on the rise. This is driven, in large part, by an understanding of the potential these services have to improve and even save lives. The key to sustaining high confidence and acceptance in digital health services comes down to the responsible management of providers with their user’s personal data. As a co-founder of a startup that works in the behavioral analytics space, privacy comes up, a lot. And frankly, it should. Companies in the digital health space are asking a lot of users in the type of information that they are asking for and storing. What’s exciting is that as an industry, we are just getting started. Digital health innovations using mobile phones, wearables, and extended reality, are revolutionizing assessment, treatment, and self-enabled care. But the true benefits of this innovation will be lost if user’s data is mismanaged, and that trust is broken. I’m not talking about the bad actors that purposely share their users information for profit. I’m talking about new digital health apps and services that create a service or a product for the purpose of genuinely helping people and their duty of care with the data they collect. We have a litmus test at Sahha, if the information you are collecting is more for the benefit of the company than the person you are serving, then that’s a clue as to your purpose. As a startup, what is the best approach to building privacy and data security?​ If you are a typical startup, your primary focus is on developing a service that has product market fit and providing value to your customer at a price they are willing to pay. But in a digital health startup, how you manage your customer’s data and privacy is as important as product market fit. The challenge we had at Sahha was understanding our duty of care and regulatory responsibilities to guide how our engineers and developers build the product. We took guidance in the Privacy by Design principles, but found them too high level for practical applications. Our method was to take the first key principle of Privacy by Design, take a proactive approach, and apply it to the product concept.​ Our approach was to partner with privacy and data security experts and asked them to complete a privacy impact assessment (PIA) on our product and architectural concepts. By having the PIA performed on the product concept, we easily identified the data security and privacy pain points our customer’s would have and the regulatory hurdles we would need to account for. Instead of building a house and retrofitting it to code, we understood in advance what the regulations/concerns would be, and built to accommodate for them. Moreover, we asked our experts what are realistic advances in regulations that we can expect in the next couple of years so we can be proactive and future proof our solutions. The digital health industry is and exciting area of innovation, it is incumbent on its innovators to be good stewards of user’s data and privacy in order to ensure its success. How did your startup navigate through its initial data privacy journey?​ Subscribe to Sahha | News How digital-phenotyping, artificial intelligence and machine learning will change the world of product development.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder that causes an individual to have trouble falling asleep and/or trouble to stay asleep at night. Whereas, hypersomnia is a sleep disorder that causes an individual to have trouble staying awake during the day despite getting a night’s sleep, excessive daytime napping, and increases in night-time wakefulness. About 75% of the individuals that are diagnosed with some form of depression suffer from insomnia (Sleep Foundation, 2022). About 16-20% of individuals with depression (Tsuno et al., 2005) and 10-50% of individuals with other mood disorders suffer from hypersomnia (Kaplan et al., 2009; Geoffrey et al., 2018). Some studies have suggested that insomnia and hypersomnia may manifest prior to the manifestation of depressive disorders (Riemann &amp; Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg &amp; Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas &amp; Perlis, 2020), making sleep abnormalities an important predictor of depressive disorder in various different demographic population groups. With regards to specific depressive disorders, previous studies have suggested that insomnia complains are one of the most common during the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Geoffrey et al., 2018) but hypersomnia appears to be more prevalent in individuals with bipolar disorder (Murru et al., 2019), and seasonal affective disorder during winter (Tsuno et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2009). The co-occurrence of hypersomnia and insomnia is more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, panic disorders, and PTSD (Murru et al., 2019; Geoffrey et al., 2018). During the treatment of depressive disorders, sleep problems tend to improve and eventually disappear (Lustberg &amp; Reynolds III, 2003), however, sleep problems especially insomnia tend to manifest again prior to a relapse (Lustberg &amp; Reynolds III, 2003; Murru et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2009; Vargas &amp; Perlis, 2020). An improvement in sleep during the treatment period positively indicated an improvement in the overall prognosis of depressive disorders (Vargas &amp; Perlis, 2020). Therefore, monitoring sleep throughout the treatment duration and during follow-up periods may prove beneficial to the individual and the clinician as the continual or re-emergence of sleep abnormalities may be an important indicator of worsening symptoms and relapse, respectively.

Since sleep problems may manifest as early as 1-3 years before depressive disorder onset (Riemann &amp; Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg &amp; Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas &amp; Perlis, 2020), early diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and/or hypersomnia may allow for a better treatment outcome through preventative and/or through early-interventions, potentially preventing the onset of major depressive disorder (or other depressive disorders) in at-risk individuals (Franzen &amp; Buysse, 2008; Vargas &amp; Perlis, 2020). Monitoring sleep after the treatment period may help the individual and the clinician to detect potential relapse and may provide added reassurance. Digital markers could potentially provide a solution by using machine learning and behavioral sleep data from smartphones and other wearables to predict mental health issues and outcomes, objectively. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones and other wearables could be used by mental health service providers to passively collect sleep data to measure for any sleep abnormality that may be present to determine if an individual is at risk of developing depressive or other psychiatric disorders. Passively collected sleep data would allow an individual to monitor their sleep data and be aware of any potential risks of depression onset or relapse. Digital markers could be used as an early-detection assessment method but also could be used in the post-treatment follow-up care plan. So, digital markers could be important for the individual with the underlying mental health concern but can also be beneficial as a tool for the clinician.

Label: Often used synonymously with “class”, label is the variable we wish to predict with the model. E.g., The Sahha binary classifier classifies input data into classes/labels: (depressed, not-depressed) Observation: A data point Class imbalance: Where the class distribution is not equal and is instead skewed. True positives: An outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class True negatives: An outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class False positives: An outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class False negatives: An outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class Dataset: A collection of data. For the purposes of Sahha’s model, the dataset used to train and evaluate a model’s performance is a tabular dataset, which is data organised into rows representing observations and columns representing attributes for those observations. Accuracy: The fraction of classifications a model made correctly. Recall: For a given class, recall is the number of correct classifications made for that class divided by the total number of observations that are in that class. Precision: For a given class, precision is the number of correct classifications made for that class divided by the total number of observations the model predicted to be that class.

Some models have trade-offs between recall and precision. For example, depending on the accuracy performance of the model tightening or loosening the decision threshold of the model will allow you to increase or decrease precision or recall. What’s a real use-case for this? Let’s say it’s of high importance that your model performs well in identifying correctly classified depressed data-points (true-positives) because you’d rather be certain you have a depressed data-point than perhaps not having one. In this case high precision would be required, potentially sacrificing recall.

The disabilities manifested due to the presence of depressive disorders can directly impact an individual’s well-being by influencing an individual's mood, self-esteem, self-confidence, appetite, sleep pattern, and behaviours. These issues can further impact an individual’s interpersonal relationships leading to social withdrawal and lower-levels of adaptive coping (Kinderman et al., 2018), which would also contribute towards a worsening individual well-being. Further, an individual is expected to receive an assessment and treatment for their worsening well-being. The diagnosis and treatment process for depression tend to be financially costly (Okumura &amp; Higuchi, 2011; Thomas &amp; Morris, 2003; Sobocki et al., 2006) for most individuals. The direct medical cost of depression could be costs associated with outpatient care, prescription drugs, and hospitalisations (Okumura &amp; Higuchi, 2011; Thomas &amp; Morris, 2003; Sobocki et al., 2006). For the individual, indirect costs of depression can be costs associated with time-intensive assessment and treatment process. Traditional methods of assessment and treatment of mental disorder requires a one on one meeting between the individual with the clinician. The treatment can last anywhere from 2-12 months (Lin et al., 2006) depending on the type of depressive disorder, type of intervention, severity of the depression, the presence of other comorbid disorders, and/or the presence of any physical medical conditions. "},{"title":"2) Suicide-related costs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The economic burden of depression","url":"/blog/the-economic-burden-of-depression#2-suicide-related-costs","content":"At its worse, depression can lead to the manifestation of self-harm tendencies, suicidal ideations, failed suicide attempt and suicide in individuals (O’Dea &amp; Tucker, 2005). The direct economic cost of suicide in New Zealand includes the cost of police and fire department involvement, funeral costs, cost of victim support, forensic costs, post-mortems, and inquests. The direct economic cost of suicide attempts are similar as the emergency response teams, ambulance, hospital treatment and emergency department costs are accounted for. The economic cost per suicide attempt and suicide can range anywhere between $3500-$10,000 per person as per the report by Ministry of Health (2005). The indirect costs associated with self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide to the individual would include the cost poorer wellbeing, lowered life satisfaction, and the cost of life. In the cases of suicide attempts and completed suicide, the loss of production includes the absence of the individual involved, support and/or bearvement days for the immediate friends and family members (O’Dea and Tucker, 2005). "},{"title":"3) Workplace-related costs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The economic burden of depression","url":"/blog/the-economic-burden-of-depression#3-workplace-related-costs","content":"Additionally, the individual’s burden of depressive disorder also comes with a cost to their workplace and to the society at large. Workplace-related costs increase when an employee or a group of employees are suffering from depression. As individuals with depression tend to have poorer wellbeing and life-satisfaction, these employees are more likely to miss days of work (absenteeism) and are more likely to engage in reduced productivity at work (presenteeism) compared to their non-depressed peers (American Psychiatric Association, 2021). In the US, workplace costs have seen the greatest increase in depression-related costs, more than the cost associated with the direct medical bills and suicide-related costs, increasing from 48% to 61% between 2010-2018 (Greenberg et al., 2021). Estimates have indicated that depression costs upto $24 billion each year to US employers (Steward et al., 2003). In many countries around the world, depression-related workplace costs has been found to largest cost to the economy (Okumura &amp; Higuchi, 2011; Greenberg et al., 2021). Since depression-related workplace costs comes at the greatest cost to the economy across the globe, it is imperative that employees with depression are screened to improve treatment and intervention outcomes for the individual, further improving the economic outcome of the workplace and the economy at large. It was found that about 60% of the people with major depressive disorder were employed in full-time and part-time positions, people that were employees were more likely to seek treatment for their conditions compared to people that were unemployed (American Psychiatric Association, 2021). Many researchers believe that applying screening and intervention tools in a workplace environment can improve depression management and depression treatment outcomes, which can then positively impact the individual, the workplace, and the society at large (Okumura &amp; Higuchi, 2011; Greenberg et al., 2021; Lerner et al., 2021). Objective assessment of Depression - a solution? The burden of depression is shared, however, it can often be treated as the burden of the individual suffering. Taking a holistic approach to recognise how depression can be costly to the individual, their immediate environment (friends and family), their workplace performance, and the society can provide us with a better insight into the urgency of treating depression. Due to the high prevalence rate, severity of disability, and the indirect and direct costs associated with depression, there is a need for better assessment and treatment for the disorder. Effective assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders can help reduce the burden of these disorders for the individual and for the society at large. However, current methods of assessment relies heavily on the subjective clinician’s judgement that relies on the criteria of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and/or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th ed. (ICD-10; World Health Organisation, 2010). As a result, the assessment process can be time-consuming and inaccessible for a lot of the population. Another drawback of relying on subjective measures of diagnosis is that individuals can be misdiagnosed leading to false negative (i.e. individuals with depression tend to not be diagnosed or under-diagnosed) and false positive cases (i.e. individuals without depression tend to be diagnosed incorrectly or over-diagnosed; Klinkman et al., 1998; Vermani et al., 2011; World Health Organization, 2021). Further, barriers to effective mental health care in the form of fewer mental health-care providers, lack of resources, and the social stigma associated with seeking support for mental health concerns could also prompt an individual to not seek support which could further worsen their condition. Therefore, there is a clear need for an objective method of assessment to aid diagnosis. Digital markers could potentially provide a solution by using machine learning and behavioural data from smartphones and other wearables to predict mental health issues objectively. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones could be used by mental health service providers to passively collect various behavioural data to determine user well-being. Passively data collection minimises the time constraints and inaccessibility issue as the user would not have to actively engage in any activity nor would they have to interact with a clinician. Digital markers could be used as an early-detection assessment method which can be of prime importance to reduce depression-related costs in a workplace setting.

Broadly, it was also found that the minority groups (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) in the UK were less likely to be comfortable sharing their health data for artificial intelligence (AI) research.

Users are less likely to comply if their health data is used for the profit of a third-party organization and/or if their anonymized data can be de-anonymized (Aggarwal et al., 2020). Users lacked trust in organizations if they felt constantly under surveillance if they were data sharing, making them less willing to share (Murphy et al., 2021). Users were less likely to share personal information that they thought would portray them negatively exposing them to judgement and scrutiny by the researcher or other personals involved (Di Matteo et al., 2018). Users were more willing to data share if they had perceived control over the data they were sharing and if there was an option to ‘opt-out’, should they want to (Murphy et al., 2021). Users were also more willing to share if they were made aware about who has access to their health data and the purpose of data collection (Kim et al., 20015; Aggarwal et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2021; Jaana &amp; Paré, 2020). "},{"title":"How to increase user willingness to share?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"User’s ‘Permission’ in Digital Health","url":"/blog/users-permission-in-a-digital-space#how-to-increase-user-willingness-to-share","content":"Since most users lacked knowledge about AI research and mobile phone data sharing, increasing user awareness about the principles of AI and ML research and how collecting their behavioural health data (Aggarwal et al., 2020) would contribute to 1) their well-being and 2) the well-being of the wider-population. Additionally, users should also be made aware of how their information is being used, with additional emphasis placed on the privacy and confidentiality issues (Murphy et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2015; Jaana &amp; Paré, 2020). where applicable, users should be reassured that their data is deanonymized and processed by automated statistical model, and only very rarely is all of their information available to an individual (Murphy et al., 2021; Di Matteo et al., 2018). Users should not be concerned about scrutiny by anyone involved in the data analysis process. While this paper focuses on the attitudes of different groups of people on data sharing, it is important to remember that participants were simply asked about their willingness to share in most of the studies described in this paper. For the most part, participants’ actual behaviour towards data sharing was not measured. Their attitudes about data sharing may not tell us a lot about their actual behaviours but may be a good indicator of it. In any case, increasing awareness about technological advances made in AI and ML research could a) increase user-willingness; b) provide the users more information about how they can benefit from the technological advancements.

Don't ask users to work.","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/want-great-ux-dont-ask-users-to-work","content":"How today's digital health app users perceive value An effective mobile app is easy to understand, quick to onboard, and fun to use. Put another way, with little to no work from the user, the app delivers the value one expects time and time again. The mobile app landscape is littered with health and wellbeing products failing to gain and retain users because they miss one or more of the aforementioned criteria above. Often, the value proposition is compelling, but the user is required to perform too much (and sometimes anything more than nothing is too much) work within the app to receive the anticipated value. Given that “value” is subjective, it is the user’s perception, not the creating company’s, that is the most important opinion when assessing value. As a general rule of thumb, the more work a user needs to do to receive expected value, whether it is during initial sign up or on an ongoing basis, the lower the perceived value of that app will be. One of the ways that mobile apps require work from their users is by prompting them to enter data, to tell the app something, so that the app can return the value in whatever form that takes (e.g. interventions, recommendations, education). Despite knowing a benefit awaits them, users are tired of being asked information or inputting information, so the perceived value falls, with retention and engagement soon following. Two examples of digital health apps that reduce the work their users do are Fitbit and MyFitnessPal. At the time of their inceptions, both apps placed heavy burdens on their users to input data. The more a user gave, the more they received. Over time, the apps began to leverage technology and data to track fitness, nutrition, and other elements automatically. This shift continues today with both apps continuing to enjoy healthy acquisition and retention metrics. Digital health mobile apps with the highest perceived value require the fewest user inputs and ask for the least amount of user effort. How can health apps reduce user “work” so their perceived value increases? The solution is often outside of the bounds of what we consider standard procedure while engineering apps. Fitbit used behavioral signals from their devices to transmit data that would otherwise be manually entered into forms, and MyFitnessPal utilized barcode scanning technology to capture nutrition information from food labels so the user didn’t have to search and then store this information manually. Both apps turned to new technology (at the time) in order to solve the “user work” problem. New technologies like AI/ML are now accessible to most developers through simple to integrate API’s and health data can be captured by means other than user-driven forms by readily available open API’s from device manufacturers such as Apple or Android. There is swiftly becoming less reasons to ask users for the data needed to deliver value to them, so long as their permission is granted to capture it, and thanks to modern approaches to putting data sharing and privacy control in the hands of users approaches like this are becoming more frequently used by modern app developers. Data without forms, and answers without questions is an easier proposition than one would think when it comes to creating the future of digital health.
