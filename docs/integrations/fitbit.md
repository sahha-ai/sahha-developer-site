Sync data between Fitbit and Sahha.

---

## iOS

Unfortunately, Fitbit does not provide an official method for syncing health data with Apple Health. This is because Fitbit is owned by Google and is a direct competitor with Apple.

## Android

Your Android app users will need to perfom a one-time connection between Fitbit and Health Connect on their Android device.

Once the user has completed this process, the Sahha SDK will be able to collect the synced Fitbit health data directly from Health Connect without any further effort from the user.
