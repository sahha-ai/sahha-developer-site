Sync data between Garmin and Sahha.

## iOS

Your iOS app users will need to perfom a one-time connection between Garmin and Apple Health on their iOS device.

Once the user has completed this process, the Sahha SDK will be able to collect the synced Garmin health data directly from Apple Health without any further effort from the user.

Please read and share this guide with your iOS app users.
