# Health Software Designation

Sahha as it pertains to Health Software Designation

---

According to TGA and our intended uses for Sahha’s software products Sahha is not considered Software as a Medical Device.

As per the the TGA FAQ: https://www.tga.gov.au/software-based-medical-devices-faqs

## Excluded Software

**Note**: the use of AI technology in software will not directly dictate whether it is excluded. The intended purpose of the software will determine if the product is in scope of regulation or not.

Software that is intended to automate diagnosis, treatment decisions, or otherwise replace the
judgment of a health professional, is unlikely to be excluded. 

- Sahha is not intended to replace the judgement of a health professional.

### Examples of excluded software:

- A consumer health and wellness product not intended to manage serious conditions, such as
a wearable that allows the wearer to track their heart rate for fitness.
  - ***Many Sahha customers fall into this category.***

- Behavioural change or coaching software for improving general health parameters (for
example weight, exercise, salt intake), such as a ‘sun smart’ app that gives user alerts for UV
protection to minimise skin cancer risk.
  - ***Many Sahha customers fall into this category.***
    
- Patient recorded outcome measures (PROMs) and patient surveys (including those that form
part of an electronic health record).
  - For example, an app that digitises an established PROM
    questionnaire to assess the quality of life of a patient undergoing cancer treatment, similar to a paper-based version.
  - ***Many Sahha customers fall into this category.***

- Software that replicates paper-based mental health assessments in electronic format. The
information must be from authoritative medical sources, as recognised by the relevant field
or discipline, and must be cited in the software. The results can be independently reviewed
by a health professional.
  - ***Sahha’s technology and many customers fall under this example***

- Communication software that enables telehealth consultations or supports a clinician in
making a remote diagnosis, such as:
  - Software intended to facilitate a video conference with a medical practitioner, with a
    waiting room facility.
  - Software that communicates information from a health professional to their patient, for
    example, non-urgent (i.e. not requiring immediate action) test results.
  - ***Many Sahha customers fall into this category.***

- Software intended to administer or manage health processes or facilities, rather than patient
clinical use cases. This includes software for the processing of financial records, claims,
billing, appointment schedules, business analytics, admissions, practice and inventory
management, utilisation, cost effectiveness, health benefit eligibility, population health
management, and workflow.
  - ***Many Sahha customers fall into this category.***
