According to the DSM-5, changes in sleep-wake mechanisms such as the manifestation of insomnia and/or hypersomnia is a common symptoms present in a few depressive disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Previous studies have suggested that sleep disturbances are present in about 90% of individuals with depression (Soehner et al., 2014). Tsuno et al. (2005) found that individuals with depression experience a variety of sleep disturbances such as decreased deep sleep, decreased rapid-eye movement (REM) stage sleep latency, and increases in the proportion of the time spent in REM in the early half of the night. It was also suggested that individuals with depression are more likely to experience impaired sleep continuity and duration (Tsuno, Bassett, & Richie, 2005; Franzen & Buysse, 2008), may have problems initiating sleep (Franzen & Buysse, 2008), and may experience early morning-awakenings (Franzen & Buysse, 2008)."),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"insomnia-and-hypersomnia-in-depression"},"Insomnia and Hypersomnia in Depression"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The sleep problems experienced during depression can be grouped under two broad sleep disorder categories: insomnia and hypersomnia.

Whereas, hypersomnia is a sleep disorder that causes an individual to have trouble staying awake during the day despite getting a night\u2019s sleep, excessive daytime napping, and increases in night-time wakefulness. About 75% of the individuals that are diagnosed with some form of depression suffer from insomnia (Sleep Foundation, 2022). About 16-20% of individuals with depression (Tsuno et al., 2005) and 10-50% of individuals with other mood disorders suffer from hypersomnia (Kaplan et al., 2009; Geoffrey et al., 2018)."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Some studies have suggested that insomnia and hypersomnia may manifest prior to the manifestation of depressive disorders (Riemann & Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), making sleep abnormalities an important predictor of depressive disorder in various different demographic population groups. With regards to specific depressive disorders, previous studies have suggested that insomnia complains are one of the most common during the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Geoffrey et al., 2018) but hypersomnia appears to be more prevalent in individuals with bipolar disorder (Murru et al., 2019), and seasonal affective disorder during winter (Tsuno et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2009).

An improvement in sleep during the treatment period positively indicated an improvement in the overall prognosis of depressive disorders (Vargas & Perlis, 2020).

Since sleep problems may manifest as early as 1-3 years before depressive disorder onset (Riemann & Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), early diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and/or hypersomnia may allow for a better treatment outcome through preventative and/or through early-interventions, potentially preventing the onset of major depressive disorder (or other depressive disorders) in at-risk individuals (Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Vargas & Perlis, 2020).

Passively collected sleep data would allow an individual to monitor their sleep data and be aware of any potential risks of depression onset or relapse.
