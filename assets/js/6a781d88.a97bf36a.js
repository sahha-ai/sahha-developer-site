A study conducted by Santomauro et al. (2021) found that the high infection rates of COVID-19 and the reduced human mobility were both positively associated with the increase in the prevalence of depressive disorders. Depression is more prevalent in females than in males (World Health Organization, 2021), with this gender gap widening in the depression cases that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic (Santomauro et al., 2021). Nearly, 50% of the individuals that die of suicide have previously had depression. Further, individuals with depression are 25 times more likely to die by suicide than individuals in the general population (Centre for suicide prevention, 2014). The burden of depression is spread across different domains such as well-being, social, and economic.\\n\\n## The direct and indirect costs of depression\\n\\n### 1) To the individual\\nLiving with any mental disorder comes at a great cost to the individual. The disabilities manifested due to the presence of depressive disorders can directly impact an individual\u2019s well-being by influencing an individual\'s mood, self-esteem, self-confidence, appetite, sleep pattern, and behaviours. These issues can further impact an individual\u2019s interpersonal relationships leading to social withdrawal and lower-levels of adaptive coping (Kinderman et al., 2018), which would also contribute towards a worsening individual well-being. Further, an individual is expected to receive an assessment and treatment for their worsening well-being. The diagnosis and treatment process for depression tend to be financially costly (Okumura & Higuchi, 2011; Thomas & Morris, 2003; Sobocki et al., 2006) for most individuals. The direct medical cost of depression could be costs associated with outpatient care, prescription drugs, and hospitalisations (Okumura & Higuchi, 2011; Thomas & Morris, 2003; Sobocki et al., 2006). For the individual, indirect costs of depression can be costs associated with time-intensive assessment and treatment process. Traditional methods of assessment and treatment of mental disorder requires a one on one meeting between the individual with the clinician. The treatment can last anywhere from 2-12 months (Lin et al., 2006) depending on the type of depressive disorder, type of intervention, severity of the depression, the presence of other comorbid disorders, and/or the presence of any physical medical conditions.\\n\\n### 2) Suicide-related costs\\nAt its worse, depression can lead to the manifestation of self-harm tendencies, suicidal ideations, failed suicide attempt and suicide in individuals (O\u2019Dea & Tucker, 2005). The direct economic cost of suicide in New Zealand includes the cost of police and fire department involvement, funeral costs, cost of victim support, forensic costs, post-mortems, and inquests. The direct economic cost of suicide attempts are similar as the emergency response teams, ambulance, hospital treatment and emergency department costs are accounted for. The economic cost per suicide attempt and suicide can range anywhere between $3500-$10,000 per person as per the report by Ministry of Health (2005). The indirect costs associated with self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide to the individual would include the cost poorer wellbeing, lowered life satisfaction, and the cost of life. In the cases of suicide attempts and completed suicide, the loss of production includes the absence of the individual involved, support and/or bearvement days for the immediate friends and family members (O\u2019Dea and Tucker, 2005).\\n\\n### 3) Workplace-related costs\\nAdditionally, the individual\u2019s burden of depressive disorder also comes with a cost to their workplace and to the society at large. Workplace-related costs increase when an employee or a group of employees are suffering from depression. As individuals with depression tend to have poorer wellbeing and life-satisfaction, these employees are more likely to miss days of work (absenteeism) and are more likely to engage in reduced productivity at work (presenteeism) compared to their non-depressed peers (American Psychiatric Association, 2021). In the US, workplace costs have seen the greatest increase in depression-related costs, more than the cost associated with the direct medical bills and suicide-related costs, increasing from 48% to 61% between 2010-2018 (Greenberg et al., 2021). Estimates have indicated that depression costs upto $24 billion each year to US employers (Steward et al., 2003). In many countries around the world, depression-related workplace costs has been found to largest cost to the economy (Okumura & Higuchi, 2011; Greenberg et al., 2021).\\n\\nSince depression-related workplace costs comes at the greatest cost to the economy across the globe, it is imperative that employees with depression are screened to improve treatment and intervention outcomes for the individual, further improving the economic outcome of the workplace and the economy at large. It was found that about 60% of the people with major depressive disorder were employed in full-time and part-time positions, people that were employees were more likely to seek treatment for their conditions compared to people that were unemployed (American Psychiatric Association, 2021). Many researchers believe that applying screening and intervention tools in a workplace environment can improve depression management and depression treatment outcomes, which can then positively impact the individual, the workplace, and the society at large (Okumura & Higuchi, 2011; Greenberg et al., 2021; Lerner et al., 2021).\\n\\nObjective assessment of Depression - a solution?\\nThe burden of depression is shared, however, it can often be treated as the burden of the individual suffering. Taking a holistic approach to recognise how depression can be costly to the individual, their immediate environment (friends and family), their workplace performance, and the society can provide us with a better insight into the urgency of treating depression. Due to the high prevalence rate, severity of disability, and the indirect and direct costs associated with depression, there is a need for better assessment and treatment for the disorder. Effective assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders can help reduce the burden of these disorders for the individual and for the society at large.\\n\\nHowever, current methods of assessment relies heavily on the subjective clinician\u2019s judgement that relies on the criteria of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and/or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th ed. (ICD-10; World Health Organisation, 2010). As a result, the assessment process can be time-consuming and inaccessible for a lot of the population. Another drawback of relying on subjective measures of diagnosis is that individuals can be misdiagnosed leading to false negative (i.e. individuals with depression tend to not be diagnosed or under-diagnosed) and false positive cases (i.e. individuals without depression tend to be diagnosed incorrectly or over-diagnosed; Klinkman et al., 1998; Vermani et al., 2011; World Health Organization, 2021). Further, barriers to effective mental health care in the form of fewer mental health-care providers, lack of resources, and the social stigma associated with seeking support for mental health concerns could also prompt an individual to not seek support which could further worsen their condition. Therefore, there is a clear need for an objective method of assessment to aid diagnosis.\\n\\nDigital markers could potentially provide a solution by using machine learning and behavioural data from smartphones and other wearables to predict mental health issues objectively. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones could be used by mental health service providers to passively collect various behavioural data to determine user well-being. Passively data collection minimises the time constraints and inaccessibility issue as the user would not have to actively engage in any activity nor would they have to interact with a clinician. Digital markers could be used as an early-detection assessment method which can be of prime importance to reduce depression-related costs in a workplace setting.\\n\\nReferences\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

According to the DSM-5, changes in sleep-wake mechanisms such as the manifestation of insomnia and/or hypersomnia is a common symptoms present in a few depressive disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Previous studies have suggested that sleep disturbances are present in about 90% of individuals with depression (Soehner et al., 2014). Tsuno et al. (2005) found that individuals with depression experience a variety of sleep disturbances such as decreased deep sleep, decreased rapid-eye movement (REM) stage sleep latency, and increases in the proportion of the time spent in REM in the early half of the night. It was also suggested that individuals with depression are more likely to experience impaired sleep continuity and duration (Tsuno, Bassett, & Richie, 2005; Franzen & Buysse, 2008), may have problems initiating sleep (Franzen & Buysse, 2008), and may experience early morning-awakenings (Franzen & Buysse, 2008).\\n\\n## Insomnia and Hypersomnia in Depression\\n\\nThe sleep problems experienced during depression can be grouped under two broad sleep disorder categories: insomnia and hypersomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that causes an individual to have trouble falling asleep and/or trouble to stay asleep at night. Whereas, hypersomnia is a sleep disorder that causes an individual to have trouble staying awake during the day despite getting a night\u2019s sleep, excessive daytime napping, and increases in night-time wakefulness. About 75% of the individuals that are diagnosed with some form of depression suffer from insomnia (Sleep Foundation, 2022). About 16-20% of individuals with depression (Tsuno et al., 2005) and 10-50% of individuals with other mood disorders suffer from hypersomnia (Kaplan et al., 2009; Geoffrey et al., 2018).\\n\\nSome studies have suggested that insomnia and hypersomnia may manifest prior to the manifestation of depressive disorders (Riemann & Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), making sleep abnormalities an important predictor of depressive disorder in various different demographic population groups. With regards to specific depressive disorders, previous studies have suggested that insomnia complains are one of the most common during the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Geoffrey et al., 2018) but hypersomnia appears to be more prevalent in individuals with bipolar disorder (Murru et al., 2019), and seasonal affective disorder during winter (Tsuno et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2009). The co-occurrence of hypersomnia and insomnia is more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, panic disorders, and PTSD (Murru et al., 2019; Geoffrey et al., 2018).\\n\\nDuring the treatment of depressive disorders, sleep problems tend to improve and eventually disappear (Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003), however, sleep problems especially insomnia tend to manifest again prior to a relapse (Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003; Murru et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2009; Vargas & Perlis, 2020). An improvement in sleep during the treatment period positively indicated an improvement in the overall prognosis of depressive disorders (Vargas & Perlis, 2020). Therefore, monitoring sleep throughout the treatment duration and during follow-up periods may prove beneficial to the individual and the clinician as the continual or re-emergence of sleep abnormalities may be an important indicator of worsening symptoms and relapse, respectively.\\n\\n## Early detection of depression via sleep sensors\\nAs sleep disturbances are important predictors of onset and relapse of depressive disorders and other related psychiatric disorders (Murru et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2009; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), monitoring sleep may allow an individual and clinician to seek treatment to control sleep issue, and so, avoid onset and/or re-emergence of the depression. Since sleep problems may manifest as early as 1-3 years before depressive disorder onset (Riemann & Voderholzer, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003; Lustberg & Reynolds III, 2003; Fava, 2004; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), early diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and/or hypersomnia may allow for a better treatment outcome through preventative and/or through early-interventions, potentially preventing the onset of major depressive disorder (or other depressive disorders) in at-risk individuals (Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Vargas & Perlis, 2020). Monitoring sleep after the treatment period may help the individual and the clinician to detect potential relapse and may provide added reassurance.\\n\\nDigital markers could potentially provide a solution by using machine learning and behavioral sleep data from smartphones and other wearables to predict mental health issues and outcomes, objectively. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones and other wearables could be used by mental health service providers to passively collect sleep data to measure for any sleep abnormality that may be present to determine if an individual is at risk of developing depressive or other psychiatric disorders. Passively collected sleep data would allow an individual to monitor their sleep data and be aware of any potential risks of depression onset or relapse. Digital markers could be used as an early-detection assessment method but also could be used in the post-treatment follow-up care plan. So, digital markers could be important for the individual with the underlying mental health concern but can also be beneficial as a tool for the clinician.\\n\\n## Future Direction\\n\\nThe emerging digital health field may wish to further explore the differences in specific sleep issues in the different psychiatric disorders using smartphone and/or wearable sleep sensors. As mentioned above, there are differences in sleep abnormalities for individuals with major depressive disorder (Geoffrey et al., 2018), seasonal affective disorder (Tsuno et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2009), and other psychiatric disorders (Murru et al., 2019; Geoffrey et al., 2018). It may be useful to differentiate between mental health issues based on sleep data obtained from various passive sleep sensors to improve early-detecting assessment methods and follow-up care plans.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

An example would be if a user didn\u2019t have enough sleep data within the week to qualify for our model using sleep/screen/demos, in this case, the Berg Model would handle this user by providing analysis for them with a model that doesn\u2019t need sleep data.\\n\\nCurrently, the Berg Model is made up of 16 models; one for each unique combination of the data types *{sleep, screen, gender, age}*.\\n\\n### What\u2019s coming?\\n- Improved binary classification specificity and sensitivity (on going)\\n\\n- Multi-class and PHQ9 scoring models\\n\\n- Android step model\\n\\nIf you have further questions, please reach out to engineering@sahha.ai or join our [Slack Developer Community](https://join.slack.com/t/sahhacommunity/shared_invite/zt-1w0fmfbvk-qUwQ83tJgXyjT9XSxJvKIw).\\n\\n---\\n\\n<SubscribeButton />"},{"id":"the-burden-of-anxiety-and-depressive","metadata":{"permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/the-burden-of-anxiety-and-depressive","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-22/index.md","title":"The burden of anxiety and depressive disorders","description":"Living with anxiety and depressive disorder comes at a great cost to the individual and to our society.","date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"anxiety","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/anxiety"},{"label":"depression","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/depression"}],"readingTime":4.105,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahha.ai","imageURL":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_80,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F781cf10d-e246-4795-aab2-915c0ac82d40_205x207.png","key":"sahha"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-burden-of-anxiety-and-depressive","title":"The burden of anxiety and depressive disorders","description":"Living with anxiety and depressive disorder comes at a great cost to the individual and to our society.","authors":"sahha","tags":["anxiety","depression"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Sahha Data Science Report 004","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/sahha-data-science-report-004"},"nextItem":{"title":"Understanding a simple model","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/understanding-a-simple-model"}},"content":"import SubscribeButton from \'@site/src/components/blog/subscribe\';\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Living with anxiety and depressive disorder comes at a great cost to the individual and to our society.*\\n\\n![Sahha](./banner.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn recent years, concerns about mental disorders have increased rapidly. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health disorders, currently affecting ~278 million people worldwide (Kessler, 2007; Kessler & Greenberg, 2002; Kessler, Petukhova, Sampson, & Wittchen, 2012; Ritchie & Roser, 2018). Anxiety disorders are ranked sixth most disabling among disorders generally and are linked to 7% of suicide deaths (Baxter, Vos, Scott, Ferrari, & Whiteford, 2014). Similarly, depression is also a prevalent mental health issue in today\u2019s society, with around ~280 million people affected worldwide (World Health Organization, 2021). Further, recent studies have also shown that COVID-19 survivors are at an increased risk of developing neurological and psychiatric problems including anxiety and mood disorders (Taquet et al., 2021), which would only further add to the burden of mental health issues. Nearly, 50% of the individuals that die of suicide have previously had depression. Further, individuals with depression are 25 times more likely to die by suicide than individuals in the general population (Centre for suicide prevention, 2014).\\n\\nLiving with anxiety and depressive disorder comes at a great cost to the individual and to our society. The disabilities manifested due to the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders can directly impact an individual\u2019s well-being by influencing an individuals mood, self-esteem, self-confidence, appetite, sleep pattern, and behaviour. These issues can further impact an individual\u2019s interpersonal relationships which could lead to social withdrawal and lower-levels of adaptive coping (Kinderman et al., 2018), which would also contribute towards a worsening individual well-being. Often times, poor diagnosis or misdiagnosis of mental health disorders (Vermani et al., 2011) could lead to the development of inadequate treatment plans that costs the individuals their time and money. Additionally, the individual\u2019s burden of anxiety and depressive disorder extends to lost production at work which then affects the efficiency of the overall economy (Wade, 2012).\\n\\nEffective assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders can significantly help lessen the burden of these disorders for the individual and for the society at large. However, current methods of assessment relies heavily on the subjective clinician\u2019s judgement that relies on the criteria of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and/or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th ed. (ICD-10; World Health Organisation, 2010). As a result, the assessment process can be time-consuming and inaccessible for a lot of the population. Therefore, there is a clear need for an objective method of assessment to aid diagnosis. Digital markers could potentially provide a solution by using machine learning and behavioural data from smartphones and other wearables to predict mental health issues objectively. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones could be used by mental health service providers to passively collect various behavioural data to determine user well-being. Passively data collection minimises the time constraints and inaccessibility issue as the user would not have to actively engage in any activity nor would they have to interact with a clinician. Digital markers could be used as an early-detection assessment method. An improved assessment could then be used to improve treatment and intervention strategy for the individual.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\n\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association. (2013).

More in-depth articles will be available soon.***\\n\\n## Terminology:\\n\\n**Classification:** This is the category (or label) a model assigns to an observation (or input).\\n\\n**Label:** Often used synonymously with \u201cclass\u201d, label is the variable we wish to predict with the model. E.g., The Sahha binary classifier classifies input data into classes/labels: (depressed, not-depressed)\\n\\n**Observation:** A data point\\n\\n**Class imbalance:** Where the class distribution is not equal and is instead skewed.\\n\\n**True positives:** An outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class\\n\\n**True negatives:** An outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class\\n\\n**False positives:** An outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class\\n\\n**False negatives:** An outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class\\n\\n**Dataset:** A collection of data. For the purposes of Sahha\u2019s model, the dataset used to train and evaluate a model\u2019s performance is a tabular dataset, which is data organised into rows representing observations and columns representing attributes for those observations.\\n\\n**Accuracy:** The fraction of classifications a model made correctly.\\n\\n**Recall:** For a given class, recall is the number of correct classifications made for that class divided by the total number of observations that are in that class.\\n\\n**Precision:** For a given class, precision is the number of correct classifications made for that class divided by the total number of observations the model predicted to be that class.\\n\\n**Decision threshold:** The tolerance for which the model uses when making a classification based on the predicted probabilities for each class.\\n\\nConfusing? Let\u2019s understand it all with some examples.\\n\\n## Example data set\\n\\nOur example data set will consist of 100 observations. These observations are labeled as either `depressed` or `not-depressed`.\\n\\nThe dataset is imbalanced, in this case, it means that there are more `not-depressed` samples than there are `depressed` samples.\\n\\n`100 Samples`\\n\\n`73 not-depressed`\\n\\n`27 depressed`\\n\\n## Visualising the data set\\nThe purple area represents the observations that the model classified as depressed, and similarly, the green area represents the observations the model classified as not-depressed.\\n\\nWithin the purple area the data has been classified as such:\\n\\n- 22 depressed (true positives)\\n\\n- 3 non-depressed (false positives)\\n\\nWithin the green are the data has been classified as such:\\n\\n- 70 non-depressed (true negatives)\\n\\n- 5 depressed (false negatives)\\n\\n![](./image_1.png)\\n\\n## The model\\nThe model is a binary classification model, in that it only classifies observations as either one of two classes: depressed or not-depressed.\\n\\n## Determining accuracy\\nAccuracy is determined by the number of correct classifications, divided by the total number of classifications. In this case, 70 observations are correctly classified as not-depressed plus 22 correctly classified as depressed, this equals 92 correct classifications in total.\\n\\nThe equation is simple, 92/100=0.92\\n92 correct classifications divided by 100 classifications equals 0.92 or 92%\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Let\u2019s pause, because these next parts are important** when looking at model metrics. Some models have trade-offs between recall and precision. For example, depending on the accuracy performance of the model tightening or loosening the decision threshold of the model will allow you to increase or decrease precision or recall.\\n>\\n> What\u2019s a real use-case for this? Let\u2019s say it\u2019s of high importance that your model performs well in identifying correctly classified depressed data-points (true-positives) because you\u2019d rather be certain you have a depressed data-point than perhaps not having one. In this case high precision would be required, potentially sacrificing recall.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Determining recall\\nFirst, pick which class you want to calculate the recall on. Let\u2019s use the depressed class for this example (purple outline).\\n\\nRecall is determined by the number of depressed classifications that were correct divided by the total number of depressed people in the sample.\\n\\nThe equation is simple, 22/27=0.81.\\n\\n\\n22 correct classifications divided by 27 total depressed classifications equals ~0.81 or approx. 81%.\\n\\n![](image_2.png)\\n\\n## Determining precision\\nFirst, focus on what class you wish to find the precision for. Let\u2019s again use the depressed class and not consider any of the non-depressed classifications (now faded out.\\n\\nPrecision is determined by the number of depressed classifications that were classed correctly within all of the depressed classifications, divided by the overall number of depressed classifications.\\n\\n22 correct depressed classifications divided by 25 total depressed classifications equals precision of 0.88.\\n\\n![](image_3.png)\\n\\n\\n## Improving precision\\n\\nLet\u2019s again use the depressed class and not consider the non-depressed classifications.\\n\\nBut this time we need to shrink the decision threshold. After doing so, we\u2019ve reduced\\nthe number of depressed classifications down to just 10. Of which, 9 are correctly classified as depressed and the remaining 1 is not.\\n\\nNow perform the same equation.\\n\\n9 correct classifications divided by 10 total depressed classifications equals 0.90.\\n\\nHowever, what you\u2019ll notice is that we have ignored 13 correct depressed classifications because of our more strict decision threshold, this has likely changed the recall, or \u201cthe precision-recall tradeoff\u201d. Let\u2019s see if that is true.\\n\\n![](image_4.png)\\n\\n## What is \u201cthe precision-recall tradeoff\u201d?\\n\\nThere is a nice tradeoff between recall and precision. In that, generally, if we want more precision our recall may suffer and visa-versa.\\n\\nThe recall of this model is now calculated as:\\n\\n10 correct depressed classifications divided by 27 total depressed classification, which equates to ~0.37 or approx. 37%.\\n\\n![](image_5.png)\\n\\n## Improving Recall\\n\\nNow in order to improve recall, we can similarly adjust the decision threshold to accommodate more depressed classifications.\\n\\nIn this model, all depressed classifications have been correctly classified.\\n\\n27 correct classifications divided by 27 total depressed classifications equals 1 or 100%.\\n\\n![](image_6.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nHopefully this article helps you understand core binary model metrics, and why they are important to how they perform. Of course the development of these models is much more complicated, we will release an article on this topic in the future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<SubscribeButton />"},{"id":"ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their","metadata":{"permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-14/index.md","title":"Ask users to do less - reduce their survey fatigue","description":"Well designed digital health products utilize wellbeing data to retain users","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"data science","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/data-science"}],"readingTime":4.485,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ask-users-to-do-less-reduce-their","title":"Ask users to do less - reduce their survey fatigue","description":"Well designed digital health products utilize wellbeing data to retain users","tags":["data science"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding a simple model","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/understanding-a-simple-model"},"nextItem":{"title":"User\u2019s \u2018Permission\u2019 in Digital Health","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/users-permission-in-a-digital-space"}},"content":"import SubscribeButton from \'@site/src/components/blog/subscribe\';\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Well designed digital health products utilize wellbeing data to retain users.*\\n\\n![Sahha](./banner.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nNPS, CSAT, CES\u2026PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5\u2026Question after question\u2026Survey fatigue is a common problem with many customer experiences, especially in digital health products, because product creators are often lacking in enough data points to understand their users\u2019 mental (or other) health conditions.\\n\\nMany companies approach this problem by asking the question \u201chow can we use surveys more effectively?\u201d, trying to break up longer surveys into shorter ones, send them out less frequently, ask for one-click answers (i.e. stars, numbers, or emoticons), or know when the right time is to send them out at all.\\n\\nNot many companies, however, are asking what we think is a better question: \u201chow can we understand our users in addition to or without using surveys?\u201d Asking users questions is an important part of the engagement and information gathering process, but it can be highly subjective and is biased towards users who are inherently inclined to participate anyway. As creators of digital health products aimed at helping people, how do we collect objective information to supplement the subjective from these surveys? How can we have a longitudinal view on how everyone is doing, not just an acute view on those who respond? How do we do this without intruding on people\u2019s individual lives or collecting personal information?\\n\\nWith the introduction of longitudinal objective data in the developers\u2019 toolkit, we have another perspective on how people engage with the products we build and how we can help them achieve their unique goals through that engagement.\\n\\nSolely relying on the user to tell us through surveys, questionnaires, and assessments is no longer the only option. Objective wellbeing data used in combination with subjective user-driven data provides a richer total dataset that gives a more complete, more powerful picture of what a user is experiencing and what they need in return.\\n\\n## What is survey fatigue, and why don\u2019t we like it?\\nSurvey fatigue is the lack of user participation in product-generated forms such as questionnaires, surveys, or assessments that stems from being asked too much, too often, at the wrong time, for any combination therein or for other reasons altogether. This not only impacts the data quality and data quantity for a given user, but can also lead to lower product engagement overall (when not dealing with surveys) and missed opportunities to provide the user with genuine, actionable assistance they need.\\n\\nBecause of survey fatigue, many digital health apps do not have adequate data to identify user needs. This means they are limited in the interventions they can deliver as well as the products they need to build to serve their user communities. The result of this limitation often leads to user churn, poor adoption or retention, lower revenue, and lower positive impact.\\n\\nCustomer acquisition cost (CAC) can be expensive to find, communicate with, and attract new users, so retention is paramount. If we need to keep users for the sake of our businesses and for the sake of their wellness, why would we leave something so mutually important to a series of tools that are intrusive, subjective, biased, and result in all parties losing out?\\n\\nDigital health companies need to be aware of the perceived value equation that users have with regards to their products. Requiring the user to do too much work (in this case, surveys) before they receive equivalent or more value from the product is a recipe for disaster for the company, the user, and the stakeholders on both sides.\\n\\n## Are surveys bad?\\nNot at all. When used wisely, sparingly, and on a case-by-case basis, surveys offer a way to capture valuable types of data that can be difficult to come by through other means. They are powerful tools that can build trust, foster a safe environment, and invite deeper conversation.\\n\\nThere are many surveys in use today that should continue to be used. One of our roles as innovators will be thinking of new ways to deliver these surveys as well as come up with new ones. Similarly, we have a responsibility to create new ways to combine them with other types of subjective and objective data, all for the betterment of the people we serve - our users.\\n\\n## Moving forward\\nCapturing health data via mobile applications is much more accessible today than it was just a decade ago. Both Android and iOS provide APIs that can deliver many different types of health data to a wide variety of software applications. At Sahha, we use some of this data in our machine learning models to infer predictions of psychometric surveys for different mental health conditions, such as risk of depressive episode, allowing product creators, business executives, and other digital health leaders to decide when and where to use surveys, if at all.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nMore and more people regularly use mobile apps that know us as individuals and, hence, provide great user experiences. We believe this puts the onus on digital health app creators to ensure the products being built match user expectations for value while retrieving the data essential for continual value delivery. By reducing survey fatigue and harnessing predictive technology, new products have a better chance of attracting and keeping users, and, above all else, earning the right to deliver them immense value for a long time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<SubscribeButton />"},{"id":"users-permission-in-a-digital-space","metadata":{"permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/users-permission-in-a-digital-space","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-10/index.md","title":"User\u2019s \u2018Permission\u2019 in Digital Health","description":"\u2018Data sharing\u2019 within health care broadly involves collecting data from a collective and making it available across different agencies.

Since different populations may have different attitudes about health data sharing due to a variety of reasons (e.g. different health status), we have separated the attitudes by their demographic personas.\\n\\n### General Patients\\nAggarwal et al. (2020) found that individuals with lower educational attainment were less likely to data share with the National Health Services compared to the Caucasian group and individuals that owned a smartphone. It was also found that individuals were less likely to data share with third party organisations such as insurance companies, news organisations, and technology companies even if the data was anonymised because they believed that the third part organization would profit from their information. Broadly, it was also found that the minority groups (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) in the UK were less likely to be comfortable sharing their health data for artificial intelligence (AI) research.\\n\\n### Mental Health Patients\\nDi Matteo et al. (2018) found that about 89% of the participants in their sample owned a smart phone and used internet on a daily-basis. 41% of the participants stated that they would be willing to download an app that collects their mental health data and an additional 43% would be willing if they were provided details about the functionality of the app. Further, it was found that participants were more likely to allow data sharing for screen on-off information (68%), motion sensors (53%), GPS location (54%), calendar information (52%) than for audio-related information and text-messages.\\n\\n### Millennials\\nMurphy et al.,(2021) found that millennial participants wanted to be able to control the type of location data to share such as sharing their location with ambulance services but they also wanted an option to opt-out, should they want to. Further, it was found that if individuals were made aware of how their location data will be used by health services, they were more likely to share their data. Participants also expressed that anonymising the data would minimise risk and increase trust in the services. Participants also expressed concerns surrounding risks associated storing and protecting their data. Lastly, some participants also suggested that location data sharing may increase distrust in the government.\\n\\n### Older-Adults\\nSeifert, Christen, & Martin (2018) found that older-adults that were interested in new technology, had poor health, and those that exercised regularly were those that were more likely to track their health information on their mobile devices. About 49% of all older-adult participants and 58% of older-adult participants that tracked their health information were more willing to share their health information with academic researchers rather than with third party organisations such as insurance companies. Interestingly, it was also found that individuals that were wealthy were more likely to share their health data.\\n\\n## Reasons behind user non-compliance to digital data sharing\\nBased on the studies mentioned above, the reasons behind user non-compliance stem from four basic user concerns: privacy, trust, control, and lack of awareness. Users are less likely to comply if their health data is used for the profit of a third-party organization and/or if their anonymized data can be de-anonymized (Aggarwal et al., 2020). Users lacked trust in organizations if they felt constantly under surveillance if they were data sharing, making them less willing to share (Murphy et al., 2021). Users were less likely to share personal information that they thought would portray them negatively exposing them to judgement and scrutiny by the researcher or other personals involved (Di Matteo et al., 2018). Users were more willing to data share if they had perceived control over the data they were sharing and if there was an option to \u2018opt-out\u2019, should they want to (Murphy et al., 2021). Users were also more willing to share if they were made aware about who has access to their health data and the purpose of data collection (Kim et al., 20015; Aggarwal et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2021; Jaana & Par\xe9, 2020).\\n\\n## How to increase user willingness *to share?*\\nSince most users lacked knowledge about AI research and mobile phone data sharing, increasing user awareness about the principles of AI and ML research and how collecting their behavioural health data (Aggarwal et al., 2020) would contribute to 1) their well-being and 2) the well-being of the wider-population. Additionally, users should also be made aware of how their information is being used, with additional emphasis placed on the privacy and confidentiality issues (Murphy et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2015; Jaana & Par\xe9, 2020). where applicable, users should be reassured that their data is deanonymized and processed by automated statistical model, and only very rarely is all of their information available to an individual (Murphy et al., 2021; Di Matteo et al., 2018). Users should not be concerned about scrutiny by anyone involved in the data analysis process.\\n\\nWhile this paper focuses on the attitudes of different groups of people on data sharing, it is important to remember that participants were simply asked about their willingness to share in most of the studies described in this paper. For the most part, participants\u2019 actual behaviour towards data sharing was not measured. Their attitudes about data sharing may not tell us a lot about their actual behaviours but may be a good indicator of it. In any case, increasing awareness about technological advances made in AI and ML research could a) increase user-willingness; b) provide the users more information about how they can benefit from the technological advancements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\n\\nAggarwal, R., Farag, S., Martin, G., Ashrafian, H., & Darzi, A.

This is driven, in large part, by an understanding of the potential these services have to improve and even save lives. The key to sustaining high confidence and acceptance in digital health services comes down to the responsible management of providers with their user\u2019s personal data.\\n\\n> As a co-founder of a startup that works in the behavioral analytics space, privacy comes up, a lot. And frankly, it should. Companies in the digital health space are asking a lot of users in the type of information that they are asking for and storing.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s exciting is that as an industry, we are just getting started. Digital health innovations using mobile phones, wearables, and extended reality, are revolutionizing assessment, treatment, and self-enabled care. But the true benefits of this innovation will be lost if user\u2019s data is mismanaged, and that trust is broken. \\n\\nI\u2019m not talking about the bad actors that purposely share their users information for profit. I\u2019m talking about new digital health apps and services that create a service or a product for the purpose of genuinely helping people and their duty of care with the data they collect. \\n\\nWe have a litmus test at Sahha, if the information you are collecting is more for the benefit of the company than the person you are serving, then that\u2019s a clue as to your purpose. \\n\\n#### As a startup, what is the best approach to building privacy and data security? \\n\\nIf you are a typical startup, your primary focus is on developing a service that has product market fit and providing value to your customer at a price they are willing to pay. But in a digital health startup, how you manage your customer\u2019s data and privacy is as important as product market fit. \\n\\nThe challenge we had at Sahha was understanding our duty of care and regulatory responsibilities to guide how our engineers and developers build the product. We took guidance in the Privacy by Design principles, but found them too high level for practical applications. \\n\\n#### Our method was to take the first key principle of Privacy by Design, take a proactive approach,  and apply it to the product concept. \\n\\nOur approach was to partner with privacy and data security experts and asked them to complete a privacy impact assessment (PIA) on our product and architectural concepts. By having the PIA performed on the product concept, we easily identified the data security and privacy pain points our customer\u2019s would have and the regulatory hurdles we would need to account for. Instead of building a house and retrofitting it to code, we understood in advance what the regulations/concerns would be, and built to accommodate for them. Moreover, we asked our experts what are realistic advances in regulations that we can expect in the next couple of years so we can be proactive and future proof our solutions. \\n\\nThe digital health industry is and exciting area of innovation, it is incumbent on its innovators to be good stewards of user\u2019s data and privacy in order to ensure its success.\\n\\n#### How did your startup navigate through its initial data privacy journey?\\n\\n---\\n\\n<SubscribeButton />"},{"id":"want-great-ux-dont-ask-users-to-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/want-great-ux-dont-ask-users-to-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-20/index.md","title":"Want great UX?

Put another way, with little to no work from the user, the app delivers the value one expects time and time again.\\n\\nThe mobile app landscape is littered with health and wellbeing products failing to gain and retain users because they miss one or more of the aforementioned criteria above. Often, the value proposition is compelling, but the user is required to perform too much (and sometimes anything more than nothing is too much) work within the app to receive the anticipated value.\\n\\nGiven that \u201cvalue\u201d is subjective, it is the user\u2019s perception, not the creating company\u2019s, that is the most important opinion when assessing value. As a general rule of thumb, the more work a user needs to do to receive expected value, whether it is during initial sign up or on an ongoing basis, the lower the perceived value of that app will be.\\n\\n![Sahha](./image_1.png)\\n\\nOne of the ways that mobile apps require work from their users is by prompting them to enter data, to tell the app something, so that the app can return the value in whatever form that takes (e.g. interventions, recommendations, education). Despite knowing a benefit awaits them, users are tired of being asked information or inputting information, so the perceived value falls, with retention and engagement soon following.\\n\\nTwo examples of digital health apps that reduce the work their users do are Fitbit and MyFitnessPal. At the time of their inceptions, both apps placed heavy burdens on their users to input data. The more a user gave, the more they received. Over time, the apps began to leverage technology and data to track fitness, nutrition, and other elements automatically. This shift continues today with both apps continuing to enjoy healthy acquisition and retention metrics.\\n\\n![Sahha](./image_2.png)\\n\\nDigital health mobile apps with the highest perceived value require the fewest user inputs and ask for the least amount of user effort.\\n\\nHow can health apps reduce user \u201cwork\u201d so their perceived value increases? The solution is often outside of the bounds of what we consider standard procedure while engineering apps.\\n\\nFitbit used behavioral signals from their devices to transmit data that would otherwise be manually entered into forms, and MyFitnessPal utilized barcode scanning technology to capture nutrition information from food labels so the user didn\u2019t have to search and then store this information manually. Both apps turned to new technology (at the time) in order to solve the \u201cuser work\u201d problem.\\n\\nNew technologies like AI/ML are now accessible to most developers through simple to integrate API\u2019s and health data can be captured by means other than user-driven forms by readily available open API\u2019s from device manufacturers such as Apple or Android. There is swiftly becoming less reasons to ask users for the data needed to deliver value to them, so long as their permission is granted to capture it, and thanks to modern approaches to putting data sharing and privacy control in the hands of users approaches like this are becoming more frequently used by modern app developers.\\n\\nData without forms, and answers without questions is an easier proposition than one would think when it comes to creating the future of digital health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<SubscribeButton />"},{"id":"sahha-ionic-capacitor-sdk","metadata":{"permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/sahha-ionic-capacitor-sdk","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-18/index.md","title":"Sahha SDK now supports Ionic / Capacitor","description":"Sahha SDK now supports Ionic / Capacitor","date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 18, 2022","tags":[{"label":"mobile app","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/mobile-app"},{"label":"ionic","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/ionic"},{"label":"capacitor","permalink":"/sahha-developer-site/blog/tags/capacitor"}],"readingTime":0.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"sahha-ionic-capacitor-sdk","title":"Sahha SDK now supports Ionic / Capacitor","description":"Sahha SDK now supports Ionic / Capacitor","tags":["mobile app","ionic","capacitor"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Want great UX?
